![snapshot](https://github.com/enggardwiprihastomo/Decision-Support-System-for-Cancer/blob/master/snapshots.png)

This is desktop-based application, developed in VB.Net. I created this application during my bachelor degree. Naive bayes algorithm is used to clasify which type of stroke the patient might have. There are 2 classes of stroke considered in this project, which are hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.
Patient will be able to get the result after inserting some inputs.
